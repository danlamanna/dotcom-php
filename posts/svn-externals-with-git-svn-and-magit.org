#+TITLE: SVN Externals with git-svn (and magit)
#+TAGS: svn, git, magit, emacs

At work we've made the switch to git, however we've been using SVN up to this point so I'm trying
to get a consistent process for it. This is where git-svn shines, the integration is great - and it
lets me embrace [magit (an emacs mode for git)](http://philjackson.github.com/magit/).

```git svn clone --stdlayout some-svn-url```

This gives me 90% of the functionality I need - except for one thing, svn externals. They can be
a pain, but we've used them for a number of projects in the past, and it would be great if I could
handle them seamlessly within git-svn.

Scouring stackoverflow resulted in [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/350982/520929) which
suggests using a [git-svn-clone-externals script](https://github.com/andrep/git-svn-clone-externals) to copy each one of your SVN externals (using git-svn clone) to a seperate directory which you ignore. Then symlinks the expected areas of your original codebase to the seperate directory. Presto?

From here, you can go to each git directory and perform the standard ```git svn fetch``` and ```git svn rebase``` - and keep your SVN externals up to date.

### Magit ###
However, it's no fun unless you're using magit. Magit's SVN integration is minimal (~300 lines of code) - but it gets the job done, almost.

This code simply adds an extra option "x" to the magit-svn prompt that fetches and rebases each SVN external as a git-svn repository.

  <strong>Note</strong> The above code is in <strong><a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/commit/1c959240adb109db9bc30c171da2fe3fd2dcdc7e">master of magit</a></strong>, but may or may not be in the next release

Overall, magit-svn-mode has proven to be really great, with one caveat - when you ```M-x magit-status``` in a git-svn directory it doesn't automatically
enter magit-svn-mode which can be frustrating, this code checks if your current repository is
of the git-svn variety, and enables magit-svn-mode automatically if so:
